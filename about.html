        <p class="white">Crummy Cuisine was founded in September 9th, 2018 by Joe when he had a dream to bring even the less majorily known food into popularity. when approched by [REDACTED] with the promise to make his dream come true, the two of them would then go on to create, design, and bring Crummy Cuisine to life. Joe ran the store by himself for a time while [REDACTED] handeld the business work. Joe was the main cheif, employee and janitor, "20 hour shifts with no breaks, but it was all worth it to get my Crummy food to the people." Says Joe. Joe still remebers his first customer "Gwenivere Beck" who had this to say about her first time at Crummy Cuisine. "I saw that a new store had opened up arpund my way and decided to give it a try, since it had no reviews yet, I wated to be the first. I knew this place was special as soon as I stepped through the door and that unique Crummy™ smell hit me." Since then it has been [REDACTED] years and Crummy Cuisine is more than thriving with [REDACTED] stores opened around the country.  </p>
